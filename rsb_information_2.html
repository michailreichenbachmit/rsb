    <p>The idea behind Retirement Security bonds is simple and elegant, and government inflation-indexed bonds have become quite common in the US and abroad. These bonds return a fixed yield plus the rate of inflation and can be used as the basis for guaranteeing an income (inflation-adjusted) in retirement. </p>
    <p>For example, a $100,000 investment today might allow a saver to collect $8,000 a year (in today’s dollars) for 20 years starting in the year 2035. No matter the level of inflation, the retiree gets $8,000 of purchasing power. The actual consumption level on a $100,000 investment ($8,000 in this example) would depend on the yield from a government inflation-indexed bond, the number of years of the payment (20 years in this example), and the start date of the payments (2035 in this example). </p>
    <p>The yield is known upfront and those saving for retirement could tailor the start date and years of payment to their retirement needs. Rather than trying to accumulate a certain size portfolio of financial assets and wondering whether it will be enough, this approach allows for easier consumption planning for retirement.</p>

    <h2>Consumption</h2>
    <p>By using RSB, investors ensure that the standard of living which is reached at the beginning of retirement gets preserved in the pension payments. This is achieved
    by indexing the bond payments to annual consumption in the period until the payments begin.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tripple_col_middle">
    <h2>Inflation</h2>
    <p>To ensure that the purchasing power is preserved in the retirement period, RSB payments are additionally indexed to inflation. In contrast to the consumption indexing,
    inflation is adjusted for in the build up period, but also during the period where the bond pays out pension. Thereby, retirees keep purchasing power throughout the entire duration of the pension.</p>

    <h2>Mixture of defined benefit and contribution</h2>
    <p>Traditional pensions work as defined benefit schemes, where the pension amout received is known and always fixed. This security has been replaced in recent years by defined contribution
    schemes, where only the amount paid in is locked. RSB combines the two and brings defined benefit certainty by locking in the pension payments.</p>

    <h2>RSB in current academic research</h2>
    <p>Robert C. Merton (School of Management Distinguished Professor of Finance at MIT Sloan School of Management, 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics and GCFP co-director) has long advocated for better ways to save for retirement. Prof. Merton teamed up with Arun Muralidhar, co-founder of AlphaEngine Global Investment Solutions, to put the concept of Retirement Security Bonds (RSBs) into the market. On the right are some two academic
    articles to better understand the functioning of RSB.</p>
